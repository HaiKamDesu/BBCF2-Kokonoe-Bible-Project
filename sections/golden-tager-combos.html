<p>Golden Tager combos require you to know how much health you have left since the less health you have, the more damage you'll be able to get off of it. Remember, the more you spin the stick while holding down the C button, the more damage will be tacked on when Golden Tager fires. Note that <span class="colorful-text-5">6A</span>&gt;<span class="colorful-text-5">236[D]</span>~<span class="colorful-text-3">64641236[C]</span>~<span class="colorful-text-5">]D[</span>~<span class="colorful-text-3">]C[</span> combo routes require you to have 40% HP or less, otherwise you'll end up getting regular Dreadnought Destroyer instead.
