    This a "for funsies" project made with the express purpose of combining all of the information available about Kokonoe from all guides that i could find.
</p>

<p>
    So if you are like me and have ever found yourself in one of the following situations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Not knowing what is optimal, asking, and then getting told "We don't know either"</li>
    <li>Wondering what the hell is the combo for that one specific situation where you have graviton 2.345 cm to the right of the opponent and bomb at 1.234 seconds from exploding</li>
    <li>Asking to yourself "what the fuck is superball setup and why do people keep telling me i should learn it"</li>
    <li>Getting told your combos are "virgin combos" (actual thing that happened, thx kiwami)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Then congratulations, you went to the right place.
</p>

<p>
    The idea is that instead of just tell you a combo route, give you all properties of it, including both situations where it can be done and situation it ends at.
</p>

<p>
    And after i have all combos that have ever existed, with all of their properties, you can then easily look up what you actually want to learn through a filter feature i'll code into the page (not yet done)
</p>

<p>
    Filtering, plus hiding columns you dont care about and the ability to basically code anything into anything, make this:
</p>
<p>
    <b>The Kokonoe BIBLE!</b>
</p>

<p>
    And no, this is not done yet. What you are looking at currently is me still slowly but surely structuring everything behind the scenes so i can then add the dumptruck of combos and explanations to it.
